# AI Checking the connection 


## Context

-- We have a app named as chuckeet, that offers peer to peer chat and server based chat,  and my goal as ai engineer is to train a ai engineer of use and existent model that will be given some parameters let say user net speed local network and other required parameters and what i want is my model to analize those real tinme parameters and make a decion if for eg like if good connection then go with peet to peer otherwise server based so ai should make one of these decision from the other two, and ai will be reawared some points yk , so like we need this decision should be could as this affects our real time user connection,, and this will be check whenenver a user tries to activate a new connection. 
so what is our plan going to be ,, how does a production ready flow looks like how can we integeate into the app or like how should we plan on tzking this on production scale

1) give me prompt to generate a flow diagram
2) explain me all thhe things to accomplish this and other info ,

The Agent: This is our decision-maker. In our case, the "agent" is the model we are building. Its job is to decide whether to use a P2P or a Server connection.
The Environment: This is the world the agent interacts with. For us, the environment is the current set of network conditions at a specific moment. This includes network latency, user location, device type, etc.
The State (S): A "state" is a snapshot of the environment at a particular time. It's the specific information our agent gets to make its decision. For example, a state could be:
Latency: 120ms
Device: Mobile
Chat Type: Video
Actions (A): These are the possible moves our agent can make from a given state. As you've defined, we have two actions:
Action 0: Choose a P2P connection.
Action 1: Choose a Server connection.
The Reward (R): This is the feedback from the environment after the agent takes an action in a state. It's our "treat." You've correctly identified that the user rating (which we'll derive from the qos column in your data) is the perfect reward. A high-quality call is a high reward; a poor-quality call is a low reward.



The goal is to create a "cheat sheet" called a Q-table. This table tells the agent the expected future reward for taking any action in any given state. The "Q" stands for "Quality," as in the quality of an action in a state.
A simplified Q-table would look something like this:
State	Action 0 (P2P)	Action 1 (Server)
(Latency=Low, Device=Desktop)	0.95	0.60
(Latency=High, Device=Mobile)	0.30	0.88


Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α * [r + γ * max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
Let's break it down in simple terms:
Q(s,a): The current Q-value for a given state s and action a.
α (alpha, the learning rate): This controls how much we update our Q-value based on the new information. A small alpha means the agent learns slowly.
r (the reward): The immediate reward received for taking action a in state s.
γ (gamma, the discount factor): This determines the importance of future rewards. As you noted, since each chat session is independent, we can set γ = 0. This simplifies our formula greatly!

With γ = 0, the update rule becomes:
Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α * [r - Q(s, a)]
In plain English, this means: "The new Q-value is the old Q-value, adjusted slightly by the difference between the actual reward we got (r) and what we expected (Q(s, a))."
